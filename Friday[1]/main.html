<p>My first task assigned by Codevyn was an excellent introduction to front-end development fundamentals. The objective was to build a single, simple HTML page, focusing purely on basic styling and structure. I was specifically instructed to implement a main container element with specific padding for visual breathing room. Following that, I needed to style a block of text using custom font-size and color properties to ensure readability and aesthetic appeal. The task culminated in styling a functional button, applying a distinct background color, appropriate padding, and a smooth border-radius to give it a modern, clickable appearance. This exercise effectively reinforced my understanding of CSS properties and how to apply them directly within a basic HTML structure.</p>
